## Introduction

In today's digital age, securing sensitive information is paramount. Steg-Frontend offers a next-generation solution that integrates various security measures. From secure folder zipping and AES encryption to DCT-based steganography and quantum encryption, this tool ensures that your data is hidden, encrypted, and transmitted securely.

## Features

- **Multi-Layered Security**: Combines various encryption techniques to provide robust protection.
- **AES Encryption**: Utilizes AES-128 for strong encryption of your data.
- **Steganography**: Hides data within other files to maintain confidentiality.
- **Quantum Encryption**: Leverages quantum computing principles for enhanced security.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with ReactJS for a smooth user experience.
- **Secure Folder Zipping**: Compress and encrypt files in a single step.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on different operating systems.

## Installation
